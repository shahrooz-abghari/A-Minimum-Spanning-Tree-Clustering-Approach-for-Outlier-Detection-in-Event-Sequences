**Abstract**
<p align="justify">Outlier detection has been studied in many domains. Outliers arise due to different reasons 
such as mechanical issues, fraudulent behavior, and human error. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach 
for outlier detection in a sequence dataset. The proposed approach combines sequential pattern mining, cluster analysis 
and a minimum spanning tree algorithm in order to identify clusters of outliers. Initially, the sequential pattern mining 
is used to extract frequent sequential patterns. Next the extracted patterns are clustered into groups of similar patterns. 
Finally the minimum spanning tree algorithm is used to find groups of outliers. The proposed approach has been evaluated on 
two different real datasets, i.e., smart meter data and video session data. The obtained results have shown that our 
approach can be applied to narrow down the space of events to a set of potential outliers and facilitate domain experts 
in further analysis and identification of system level issues.</p>
